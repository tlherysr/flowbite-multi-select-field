# Purpose of the Project
Since there was no multi select component for [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/), I decided to create one for one of my projects and I am sharing it with you :) Let me know if you need anything else but it works perfectly right now.


# Pre-Requisites
- This project is using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) like [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/).
- I am using Font Awesome for the chevron icon. So, please include it in your HTML as well.

# How to Use
You can copy and paste the `flowbite-multi-select.js` file to your project and include it in the page like:
```
<script src="./flowbite-multi-select.js"></script>
```

Full example code can be seen in `index.html` file.

# Thanks
I got lots of the part from [admirhodzic](https://github.com/admirhodzic/multiselect-dropdown)'s repo. So, thanks for the base code :)
